# Meower

Meower is a free, open-source, and nonprofit social media platform.

Meower-Vanilla is the original, Scratch-based client for Meower. It runs on TurboWarp and CloudLink. Meower-Vanilla serves as a template for other Meower clients. 

### [Launch Meower!](https://app.meower.org)

## Scratch clients are being retired
Scratch-based Meower clients will be moved to [Legacy-Meower-Yoom](https://github.com/meower-media-co/Legacy-Meower-Yoom) in the future. Beta 6 will be the last primary Meower client to use Scratch, and will be retired in favor of [Meower Svelte](https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Svelte).

## Changelog for this branch
Upgrade to Cloudlink 4.0 for improved compatibility and security.
